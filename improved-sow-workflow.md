# Improved SOW Generator Workflow for AnythingLLM Integration

## Current Issues Identified
- Questions won't load (likely API connectivity or rate limiting)
- Manual /exit commands needed between agent searches
- Workflow requires multiple manual steps

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling & Auto-Recovery
```javascript
// Add automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
// Add connection health checks before API calls
// Implement graceful fallback when agent mode fails
```

### 2. Streamlined Agent Mode Management
```javascript
// Automatically handle /exit commands
// Add session state tracking
// Implement proper agent mode cleanup
```

### 3. Improved User Experience
```javascript
// Add progress indicators for each research step
// Show real-time status updates
// Add manual input fallback when API fails
```

### 4. Enhanced Company Research Process
For AnythingLLM company research, the current flow is:
1. Enter "AnythingLLM" in client name field
2. Click "Search Client" → triggers @agent search
3. System automatically sends /exit after research
4. Research results populate in the research log

### 5. Service Research Enhancement
For service best practices:
1. Enter service type (e.g., "AI implementation", "LLM integration")
2. Click "Search Service" → triggers @agent search for best practices
3. System handles /exit automatically
4. Results feed into SOW generation

### 6. Intelligent SOW Generation
The system then combines:
- AnythingLLM company research data
- Service best practices research
- Your detailed project brief
- Generated personalized SOW with proper pricing

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Fix Current Implementation
- Debug the API connectivity issues
- Improve error handling and retry logic
- Add better user feedback during long operations

### Option B: Create Simplified Workflow
- Build a form-based approach with manual research input
- Add templates for common service types
- Focus on SOW generation quality over automation

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Keep automated research as primary method
- Add manual input fallbacks when automation fails
- Provide template-based quick start options

## Technical Improvements Needed

1. **API Connection Stability**
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement request queuing
   - Add timeout handling

2. **User Feedback**
   - Real-time progress indicators
   - Clear error messages
   - Estimated completion times

3. **Data Validation**
   - Input sanitization
   - Result quality checking
   - Fallback content generation

4. **Session Management**
   - Proper state tracking
   - Recovery from interruptions
   - Save/resume functionality

Would you like me to implement any of these improvements to your current SOW generator?
